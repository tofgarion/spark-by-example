** Inverting Partial_Sum and Adjacent_Difference

With our specifications for [[Partial_Sum.org][Partial_Sum]] and [[Adjacent_Difference.org][Adjacent_Difference]] we can easily show that
calling them one after the other in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
Partial_Sum(A,B);
Adjacent_Difference(B,A);
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
Adjacent_Difference(A,B);
Partial_Sum(B,A);
#+END_SRC 

will leave ~A~ unchanged. But since we just finished proving these functions with SPARK, we can also
prove these properties with SPARK.

*** Inverting Partial_Sum with Adjacent_Difference

We will first show that we can invert ~Partial_Sum~ with ~Adjacent_Difference~. In order to do this
we will write a procedure with a unique postcondition, being that our input array is left unmodified, 
and that should only call ~Partial_Sum~ and ~Adjacent_Difference~ in its implementation (except for
the SPARK annotations). Its signature is:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
Partial_Sum_Inv(A,B : in out T_Arr);
#+END_SRC

**** Specification of Partial_Sum_Inv

~Partial_Sum_Inv~ can be specified in the following way:

#+INCLUDE: ../../../numeric/numeric_inv.ads :src ada :lines "10-14"

The precondition express the preconditions of Partial_Sum, the postcondition the fact that ~A~ should
remain unchanged.

**** Implementation of Partial_Sum_Inv

Our implementation of ~Partial_Sum_Inv~ is as follows:

#+INCLUDE: ../../../numeric/numeric_inv.adb :src ada :lines "4-16"

Here we simply verify that if the length of ~A~ is greater or equal to one (nothing needs to be proven
otherwise) then after calling ~Partial_Sum~ the preconditions of ~Adjacent_Difference~ are respected.
We do this by exhibiting a relation between ~B(J)~ and ~B(J-1)~, which then enables the solvers to 
prove the precondition. The relation between the elements of ~B~ in the assertion also enables the
solvers to prove that ~Adjacent_Difference~ does indeed return ~A~ to its original state.

*** Inverting Adjacent_Difference with Partial_Sum

The methodology is the same for this proof. The signature of the "identity" function is:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
procedure Adjacent_Difference_Inv(A,B : in out T_Arr)
#+END_SRC

**** Specification of Adjcacent_Difference_Inv

~Adjacent_Difference_Inv~ can be specified in the following way:

#+INCLUDE: ../../../numeric/numeric_inv.ads :src ada :lines "15-21"

The preconditions are those of ~Adjacent_Difference~; The postcondition once again ensures that ~A~ remains unmodified.

**** Implementation of Adjacent_Difference_Inv

The implementation of ~Adjacent_Difference_Inv~ is as follows:

#+INCLUDE: ../../../numeric/numeric_inv.adb :src ada :lines "17-52"

There are more things to annotate in this function, because the preconditions of ~Partial_Sum~ are 
more constraining than the ones of ~Adjacent difference~.
In order to prove the Preconditions of ~Partial_Sum~ we will use a Ghost variable, ~Tmp~, which
will through a loop compute the partial sums of ~B~. Because we can annotate the loop with loop invariants
we can verify that in each iteration there is a relation between the elements of B, the ones of A and Tmp,
thus ensuring there is no overflow when computing the next partial sum, and the relations found help
prove that ~A~ will return to its initial state after executing ~Partial_Sort(B,A)~.

There is one important thing that needs to be pointed out in this code though. The second loop invariant
mathematicaly implies the third, as the main difference is the range used for the quantified variable ~K~.
In the second loop_invariant ~K~ ranges over indexes of ~A~ whereas in the third loop invariant ~K~
ranges over indexes of ~B~. Both are proved just fine, but if we only keep the second loop invariant then
the preconditions of ~Partial_Sum~ isn't verified, and if we only keep the third (and we add the 
relation between ~A~ and ~Acc_Def(B ...)~ then the postcondition isn't verified.

This is due to an issue with automatic solvers and arithmetics in universally quantified assertions.
If we take a look at the preconditions of [[Partial_Sum.org][Partial_Sum]] we can see that the quantified variable ~J~ is in ~A'Range~ and that 
we verify that ~Acc_Def(A,A'First,J,0).OK~ holds true. When trying to verify this precondition the solvers
will range over the previous assertions with a universally quantified variable to try and match 
the precondition, but all the assertions in our programm are in the form of ~Acc_Def(B,B'First,J-A'First+B'First,0)~.
That is why adding the third loop invariant, proving what was already proven by the second loop invariant 
is not redunant. Proving the equality of the arrays has the same issue, because proving that ~A=A'Old~ amounts
to proving that ~for all J in A'Range => A(J) = A'Old(J)~, and ranging over the indexes of ~B~ would  introduces the same issues
if we only kept the third invariant.

With this loop, and the invariants everything is prooved.
