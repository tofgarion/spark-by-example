** The Search_N algorithm

   The Search_N algorithm finds the first index in an array at which a
   value occurs a given number of times. Its signature is the
   following:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ada
     function Search_N (A : T_Arr; Val : Integer; N : Positive) return Option;
   #+END_SRC

   As usual, we will use an ~Option~ to encapsulate the result.

*** The Constant_Range_From_Location and Has_Constant_Subrange predicates

    Like usual, we define predicates to express more easily the
    specification of ~Search_N~.

    First, we define a ~Constant_Range_From_Location~ ghost function to
    express that an array contains a constant subrange of length
    ~Length~ from location ~Loc~:

    #+INCLUDE: "../../../spec/has_constant_subrange_p.ads" :src ada :range-begin "function Constant_Range_From_Location" :range-end "\s-*(\([^()]*?\(?:\n[^()]*\)*?\)*)\s-*\([^;]*?\(?:\n[^;]*\)*?\)*;" :lines "8-18"

    The preconditions avoid possible overflows.

    Then, a ~Has_Constant_Subrange~ ghost function is defined to
    express that an array has a subrange containing only a given value
    (the precondition avoids a possible overflow too):

    #+INCLUDE: "../../../spec/has_constant_subrange_p.ads" :src ada :range-begin "function Has_Constant_Subrange" :range-end "\s-*(\([^()]*?\(?:\n[^()]*\)*?\)*)\s-*\([^;]*?\(?:\n[^;]*\)*?\)*;" :lines "19-27"

*** Specification of Search_N

    The specification of ~Search_N~ is rather easy to express:

    #+INCLUDE: "../../../non-mutating/search_n_p.ads" :src ada :range-begin "function Search_N" :range-end "\s-*(\([^()]*?\(?:\n[^()]*\)*?\)*)\s-*\([^;]*?\(?:\n[^;]*\)*?\)*;" :lines "10-27"

    - the preconditions express
      - the fact that the last index of ~A~ is less than the last
        ~Positive~ value, as we will use ~A'Last + 1~ in the
        implementation.
      - the fact that ~A~ is not empty.
    - the postconditions express
      - the fact that if ~Option.Exists~ is true, then
        1. a valid index will be returned.
        2. ~Val~ occurs ~N~ times starting at the returned index.
        3. if the returned index is not the first index of ~A~, then
           for all indexes ~K~ of ~A~ less than the returned index,
           there aren't ~N~ occurrences of ~Val~ starting at the index
           ~K~.
      - the fact that if ~Option.Exists~ is false, then there are no
        subsequence with ~Val~ repeated ~N~ times in the array ~A~.

*** Implementation of Search_N

    The implementation of ~Search_N~ is the following:

    #+INCLUDE: "../../../non-mutating/search_n_p.adb" :src ada :range-begin "function Search_N" :range-end "end Search_N;" :lines "7-42"

    The loop invariants specify that:
      - no subsequence of ~N~ times the value ~Value~ has been found
        yet.
      - ~Start~ is a valid index (except for the case ~I + 1~ which
        means that the subsequence does not exist).
      - if ~Start~ is less than ~I~, then there is a constant range of
        ~Val~ starting at ~Start~ of length ~I + 1 - Start~.
      - there is no subsequence of ~N~ times the value ~Val~ in the
        range ~A'First .. I~ of the array.
      - if ~A'First~ is less than ~Start~, then the value at index
        ~Start - 1~ is different from ~Val~. This allows to prove the
        previous invariant. Indeed, there could be a subsequence of
        length ~N~ if the values before ~A(Start)~ were equal to
        ~Val~. This invariant states that ~Start~ *is* the first index
        of the constant range.

     Everything is proved by ~GNATprove~.
