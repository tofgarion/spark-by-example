* The Swap algorithm

The ~Swap~ algorithm exchanges the contents of two variables. Its
signature can be expressed as: ~procedure Swap (P : in out T; Q :
   in out T)~

** Specification of Swap

The specification of ~Swap~ is the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  is
    procedure Swap
#+END_SRC

The postcondition expresses the fact that the two variables have
actually been exchanged, using the ~'Old~ attribute available in
SPARK. This attribute stores the state of the variables *before*
the execution of the procedure.

** Implementation of Swap

The implementation of ~Swap~ is:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Swap
    (P : in out T;
     Q : in out T)
  is
     Save : T := P;
  begin
     P := Q;
     Q := Save;
  end Swap;
#+END_SRC

A memory variable is used to store the value of ~P~. Using
~GNATprove~, everything is proved.
